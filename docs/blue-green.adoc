== Preface

So you've pushed an app, and now it's time to deploy a new version.  Blue-green deployments are a technique for deploying updates with zero downtime.

Cloudfoundry allows developers to manage everything about their application: from deployment to the management of routes to an application.  It's thanks to this self-service philosophy that the task of achieving zero-downtime deployments becomes easy.

This lab will walk you through the steps to deploy a new version of an application with zero downtime, and provides a way to visualize how traffic gets routed to the new application.


== Exercises

=== Setup

. To simulate a blue-green deployment, first scale `articulate` to multiple instances.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf scale articulate -i 2
----

=== Perform a Blue-Green Deployment

. Read about using https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html[Blue-Green Deployments to reduce downtime and risk^].

. Browse to the `articulate` `Blue-Green` page.
+

. Lets assume that the deployed application is version 1.  Let's generate some traffic.  Press the `Start` button.
+
_Leave this open as a dedicated tab in your browser.  We will come back to this later._

. Observe our existing application handling all the web requests.
+

. Record the subdomain (`host`) for the `articulate` application.
+
This is our production route.  _You will use this in the next step._
+
For example:
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf routes

Getting routes as droberts@pivotal.io ...

space   host                                           domain                   apps
dev     articulate-heartsickening-elegance             pcfi1.fe.gopivotal.com   articulate
----

. Now let's `push` the next version of `articulate`.
+
However, this time we will specify the subdomain by appending `-temp` to our production route.
+
For example:
+
[source.terminal]
----
cd ~/pivotal-cloud-foundry-developer-workshop/articulate/
----
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf push articulate-v2 -p ./articulate-0.1.jar -m 512M -n {{articulate_hostname_temp}} --no-start
----

. Bind `articulate-v2` to the `attendee-service` user provided service.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf bind-service articulate-v2 attendee-service
----
+
NOTE: You can ignore the "TIP: Use 'cf restage articulate-v2' to ensure your env variable changes take effect" message at this time.

. Start the application.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf start articulate-v2
----

. Now we have two versions of our app deployed.
+
_Open a new tab_ and view version 2 of `articulate` in your browser.  Take note of the application name.
+

+
At this point in the deployment process, you could do further testing of the version you are about to release before exposing customers to it.

. Let's assume we are ready to start directing production traffic to version 2.  We need to map our production route to `articulate-v2`.
+
For example (your domain and subdomain will be different):
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf map-route articulate-v2 {{domain_name}} --hostname {{articulate_hostname}}
----

. Return to browser tab where you started the load.  You should see that it is starting to send requests to version 2.
+
[.thumb]
image::map_route.png[Map Route]

. Press the `Reset` button, so we can see how the load get distributed across app instances.
+
If you are running with a similar configuration to this:
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf apps

Getting apps in org dave / space dev as droberts@pivotal.io...
OK

name                     requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
articulate               started           2/2         512M       1G     ...
articulate-v2            started           1/1         512M       1G     ...
----
+
You should see about a third of the requests going to version 2.
+
[.thumb]
image::third.png[Third]

. Move more traffic to version 2, with:
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf scale articulate -i 1
----
+
..and:
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf scale articulate-v2 -i 2
----
+
If you `Reset` the load generator, you will see 2/3 of the traffic go to `articulate-v2`.

. Move all traffic to version 2.
+
Remove the production route from the `articulate` application.
+
For example (your domain and subdomain will be different):
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf unmap-route articulate {{domain_name}} --hostname {{articulate_hostname}}
----
+
If you `Reset` the load generator, you will see all the traffic goes to `articulate-v2`.
+
[.thumb]
image::unmap.png[Unmap]
+
NOTE: Refreshing the entire page will update the application name.

. Remove the temp route from the `articulate-v2` application.
+
For example (your domain and subdomain will be different):
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf unmap-route {{domain_name}} --hostname {{articulate_hostname}}
----

**Congratulations!** You performed a blue-green deployment.

==== Questions

* How would a rollback situation be handled using a blue-green deployment?
* What other design implications does running at least two versions at the same time have on your applications?
* Do you do blue-green deployments today?  How is this different?

=== Cleanup

Let's reset our environment.

. Delete the `articulate` application.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf delete articulate
----

. Rename `articulate-v2` to `articulate`.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf rename articulate-v2 articulate
----

. Restart `articulate`.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf restart articulate
----

. Scale down.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf scale articulate -i 1
----
